    <h1> Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! </h1>
    <p>
      Here you'll find all kinds of weird stuff to do about me. If you're
       interested in weird/wacky things that I too enjoy but have no relation
        to me, visit my blog. That's the place where i talk mostly about
        on-going updates to GenGein [my beast on an engine] or just
        qwerky/fascinating stuff!
      <br><br>
      If you are in fact here to query a brief description of myself and what i do,
       continue reading! ... Or not. That choice is completely dependant on if
       you want a good programmer or not.
      <br><br>
      My name is Jackson Luff. I'm a 19 year old game developer that has
       developed in several different languages
       ( C++, C#, JavaScript, HTML and CSS - To name a few ),
       and am currently undergoing the Advanced Diploma of Professional Game
       Development at Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE). My ambition
       fueling most of my projects is a weird adventure that consists of a
       particles (My known desire), creative chaos, a heavily inquisitive mind and, of course,
       the notorious lack of sleep.
      <br><br>
      The area of which I have succeeded most in so far would have to be
       Computer Graphics. This spurious project allowed me to bestow my passion
        upon a silver platter. To which a platter of garnished perlin noise is
        shown. Sprinkled with some GPU salt and pepper [particles], topped off with some
        cinnamon sticks for seasoning [trees]. Now that we've prepared a to-die-for
        experience - lets make it more mouth-watering by chucking it in the oven to allow the
        baked lighting to seep through. [lighting].
