    <h1> Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! </h1>
    <p>

	<img src="Images/Portrait.jpg" alt="Portrait" class="ThumbNails" id="Portrait"/>
	 My name is <b>Jackson Luff</b>. I'm a 19 year old game developer that is living 
		in Melbourne, Australia. Over a solid 6 years of game development, I've picked up 
		several languages along the way; <b> C++, C#, HTML, CSS and JS</b>. But something
		that I've gained a keen eye for over the years has been OpenGL in C++.
       I am currently undergoing the <b>Advanced Diploma of Professional Game
       Development at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE)</b>. My ambition
       fuelling most of my projects is a clash of creative chaos, the unique beauty
	   and power of <b>computer graphics</b>, and of course, the notorious lack of sleep.
	  <br><br>
      Here you'll find all kinds of weird stuff to do about me. If you're
       interested in weird/wacky things that I too enjoy, visit my blog. 
	   That's the place where i talk mostly about on-going updates to 
	   GenGein (my beast of an engine) or just qwerky/fascinating stuff!
      <br><br>

	  So as you've probably gathered from the splatter of prettiness all over your screen,
	  graphical programming is most definitely my speciality. Being creative, graphics programming gives you near
	  to infinite possibilities. Preferably working with OpenGL in C++, I have access to powerful low-level
	  tools that have allowed me to go forth with innovative creations. If you're interested as to what I've
	  <br>produced, checkout my YouTube channel down below. 
	  <br><br><br><br>
	  So, why graphics programming? I find visual response to be intriguing. 
	  That's really what differentiates app dev's from game dev's. To have 
	  thousands of lines consisting of nothing but math, logic and algorithms
	  turn into a piece of art is chaotically beautiful. Graphics programming allows me to 
	  adventure onward to all bases that both the GPU and CPU can offer when it comes to rendering.
