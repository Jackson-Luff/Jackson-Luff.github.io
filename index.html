    <h1> Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! </h1>
    <p>
	
	<img src="Images/Portrait.jpg" alt="Portrait" class="ThumbNails" id="Portrait"/>
	 My name is <b>Jackson Luff</b>. I'm a 19 year old game developer that has
       developed in several different languages; <b> C++, C#, JavaScript, HTML and CSS</b> - To name a few.
       I am currently undergoing the <b>Advanced Diploma of Professional Game
       Development at Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE)</b>. My ambition
       fuelling most of my projects is a clash of creative chaos, the unique beauty
	   and power of <b>computer graphics</b>, and of course, the notorious lack of sleep. 
	  <br><br> 
      Here you'll find all kinds of weird stuff to do about me. If you're
       interested in weird/wacky things that I too enjoy but have no relation
        to me, visit my blog. That's the place where i talk mostly about
        on-going updates to GenGein [my beast of an engine] or just
        qwerky/fascinating stuff!
      <br><br>
      If you are in fact here to query a brief description of myself and what i do,
       continue reading! ... Or not. That choice is completely dependant on if
       you want a good programmer or not.
      <br><br>

	  As you probably presumed, computer graphics is indeed the area that I enjoy
	  adventuring the most. Whether it be CPU or GPU - there is always a way to make
	  your project be pretty. As you will see throughout my projects, I thrive to post 
	  eye-catching content [e.g. this portfolio]. This is for two reasons. The first being
	  that it's hard to please everyone. But it's easy to gain a larger audience with a pretty
	  persona than with "programmer graphics". The second reason is self-assurance. There is no better
	  feeling than to overview your work as if it were an art gallery.
      <br><br>
	  <img src="Images/particles.png" alt="Particles" class="ThumbNails" id="SplashScreen01"/>
      Now, programming for myself isn't just about sitting at a computer tweaking values in
	  ugly code hoping for a result. No, Beautiful programming is my basis. What I attempt 
	  to produce are projects that retain readability and both efficiency and effectiveness.
	  How, you say? Well first the main problem present is that as the project expands, 
	  so does the probability for your project to become a plate full of spaghetti and hope.
	  Thus, I often go through my code to clean up what should be where and fix up the 
	  execution structure to ensure the code is more optimal than previously. This process
	  is often overlooked by the client, but the passion is still visible.
